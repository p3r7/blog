## An External Brain

I have a terrible memory...

And like most folks dealing w/ software architecture, I have to deal w/ a humongous amount of information.

So I take notes. Lots of them.

In fact I've extended this practice to every subjects I work on / study, with extensive cross-referencing.

The trick is not to remember stuff but to find it back quickly.


My current setup[^1] is pretty straightforward: I use [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) inside [Emacs](/tag/emacs/). To quickly search a piece of information I use [deft](https://github.com/jrblevin/deft) or sometimes [deadgrep](https://github.com/Wilfred/deadgrep).

The combination of these tools + my collection of notes act like an **external brain**.


## Digital Gardening & Zettlekasten

My notes are organized in a very specific way.

I organize them hierarchically under subfolders.

I like mid-sized files, only splitting them when they attain a critical mass in term of size or complexity.

This practice of building and maintaining a **personal wiki**, as old as the world itself, is now getting qualified of [digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)[^2]. Indeed, you just don't add content but have to regularly reorganize it, like you would clear a patch of soil.

I also stumbled upon the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) and liked its idea of bidirectional links[^3] but quickly rejected one aspect of its philosophy: creating many many small files, one for capturing each incoming thought.

Indeed, bidirectional links allow for a very fluid way to structure information (akin to what you may find in a graph database).

Still, I like to impose some structure, loosely based on how I mentally represent things. Having to deal with a gazillion files would not imped finding information back, but would discourage me from regularly _gardening_ my notes.

So while I adhered to the _digital gardening_ philosophy, I rejected (my understanding of) _Zettelkasten_.


## Org-Roam

I discovered [Org-Roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) through its accompanying visualization tool: [Org-Roam-UI](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui).

It's an extension to Org to provide it a similar feature set to [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), the most famous Zettlekasten software.

I took a quick look around and realized that the implementation isn't too intrusive:
- relies on the native `org-id` feature
- uses a local SQLite DB, but it's only a cache that is easy to prune and re-create[^4]

Furthermore, in its latest iteration it supports:
- recursive parsing of the notes directory
- having note titles different from file names

So I thought I could try activating it.


## Indexing an Existing Notes

Things worked smoothly, but I was struggling to find a command to register existing notes in Org-Roam's DB.

Calling `org-id-get-create` would allow generating an org id for current file / outline. But that wasn't sufficient to make it appear.

Indeed, I also had to register it in the `org-id-locations-file` by passing the current file path to `org-id-update-id-locations`.

Finally, I needed to call `org-roam-db-update-file` for Org-Roam to update its DB entry for the current file.

This gives:

```elisp
(defun prf/org-roam/add-index-current ()
  "Add index to file of currently visited buffer, if applicable."
  (interactive)

  (unless (and (buffer-file-name)
		       (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name)))
    (user-error "Current buffer is not visiting a file that exists on disk."))

  (unless (prf/org/file-path-indexable-p (buffer-file-name))
    (user-error "Current buffer is not visiting an indexable file."))

  (unless (org-id-get)
    (org-id-get-create)
    (call-interactively #'save-buffer))

  (org-id-update-id-locations (list (buffer-file-name)))

  (org-roam-db-update-file))
```


## Forcing Index of All Files

Sometimes I like to massively rename / move / delete note files and Org-Roam doesn't seem to be super happy about this.

Using the same logic as above, I came up w/ the following command:

```elisp
(defun prf/org-roam/rescan ()
  "Force rescan of whole `prf/dir/notes'."
  (interactive)
  (prf/org/index-rescan-all)
  (org-roam-db-sync))

(defun prf/org/index-rescan-all ()
  "Populate `org-id-locations' by rescaning recursively all files in `prf/dir/notes'."
  (interactive)
  (let ((buffs-snapshot (buffer-list)))
    (org-id-update-id-locations
     (f-files prf/dir/notes #'prf/org/file-path-indexable-p t))
    ;; NB: `org-id-update-id-locations' opens all matching files, we close them after processing
    (mapc #'kill-buffer
          (-difference (buffer-list) buffs-snapshot))))
```


## conclusion

I'm pretty happy with this setup.

The Org-Roam-UI helps me visualize the current structure of my notes and has helped me discover patterns and anomalies I had no idea existed.


## Notes

[^1]: I originally started w/ [Tomboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy_(software)), then moved to [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki), Markdown and finally to Org as soon as I started using Emacs.

[^2]: It's more than an empty buzzword. Lots of effort has been put on studying and qualifying this phenomenon. Don't hesitate to browse the rest of [Maggie Appleton's site](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) to learn more.

[^3]: Not supported natively by Org as of writting. I was circumventing this limitation by creating a link in each of the 2 cross-referenced files.

[^4]: This DB is just a cache, a _derived data systems_ (i.e. _materialized view_). The _system of record_ are the org files themselves. Hence there is no risk of unrepairable corruption.
