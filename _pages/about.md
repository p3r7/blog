## Eigenbahn blog

On this blog you'll find various ramblings about things I'm interested in.

Mainly:
 - technology & programming
 - design & craftmanship

I'm quite intrested in the union of those aspects: how we could design _man-machine interaction_ systems to ease our interaction with data.

I have an expertise in _observability_ so we'll certainly tackle data transformation and visualization.

As far as interractive text manipulation is concerned, as you'll soon find, my tool of choice is [Emacs](/tag/emacs/) (that [I do not consider as a text editor](/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor)). For those interested, there is a [dedicated atom feed](/atom.emacs.xml) for Emacs articles on this blog.


### Disclaimer

You might find essays to be assertive and opinionated.

Some might be due to English not being my native language.

Nevertheless, don't hesitate to provide constructive criticism.
I'm really glad when somebody proves me wrong.

That's how we grow as persons.
